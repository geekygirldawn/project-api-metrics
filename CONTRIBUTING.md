# Contributing to Project API Metrics

Welcome to Project API Metrics! We're happy to have you here,
and we're always looking for ways to improve these scripts.

As you get started, you are in a great position provide feedback 
about whether these scripts work as expected in your environment.

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work
- Make commits of logical units
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below)
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request

GitHub has more documentation about the [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

## Code Style

### Formatting Commit Messages

We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message.  See
[GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues
and commits.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

When opening a new issue, try to roughly follow the commit message format conventions above.
