"""Mystery Orgs
This script uses the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve relevant
information about one or more GitHub orgs.

We use this script at to gather basic data about GitHub orgs that
we believe may have been created outside of our process by various
employees across our business units. We gather the first few members
of the org to help identify employees who can provide more details
about the purpose of the org and how it is used.

As input, this script requires a file named 'orgs.txt' containing
the name of one GitHub org per line residing in the same folder 
as this script.

Your API key should be stored in a file called gh_key in the
same folder as this script.

As output:
* A message about each org being processed will be printed to the screen.
* the script creates a csv file stored in an subdirectory
  of the folder with the script called "output" with the filename in 
  this format with today's date.

output/mystery_orgs_2022-01-14.csv"
