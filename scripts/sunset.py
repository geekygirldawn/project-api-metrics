"""Gather data to determine whether a repo can be archived

This script uses the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve relevant
information about a repository, including forks to determine ownership
and possibly contact people to understand how they are using a project.
More detailed information is gathered about recently updated forks and 
their owners with the recently updated threshold set in a variable called
recently_updated (currently set to 9 months).

Usage
-----

Run the script with one repo url as input
    $python3 sunset.py -u "https://github.com/org_name/repo_name"

Run the script with a csv file containing one org_name,repo_name pair
per line:
    $python3 sunset.py -f sunset.csv

Dependencies and Requirements
-----------------------------

This script depends on another tool called Criticality Score to run.
See https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score for more details, including
how to set up a required environment variable. This function requires 
that you have version 1.0.7 of this tool installed (the older Python 
version but not the final Python version, which doesn't work for 
some reason within the script - possibly because of how they've 
implemented the deprecation warnings). You can install the correct version
using:
pip install criticality-score==1.0.7

Your API key should be stored in a file called gh_key in the
same folder as this script.

This script requires that `pandas` be installed within the Python
environment you are running this script in.

Before using this script, please make sure that you are adhering 
to the GitHub Acceptable Use Policies:
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies
In particular, "You may not use information from the Service 
(whether scraped, collected through our API, or obtained otherwise)
for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of sending unsolicited
emails to users or selling User Personal Information (as defined in the
GitHub Privacy Statement), such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards."

Output
------

* Prints basic data about each repo processed to the screen to show progress.
* the script creates a csv file stored in an subdirectory
  of the folder with the script called "output" with the filename in 
  this format with today's date.
